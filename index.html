                  Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on
                  the shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their
                  right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here,
                  in which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers
                  are hot here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the
                  spring are are absolutely amazing.

                <p class="card__content-paragraph">
                  The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and
                  soviet architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified
                  balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the
                  landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and
                  those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less
                  interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on
                  the far outskirts of the right one.

                  The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below
                  from a rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have
                  been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900
                  years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                  Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the
                  summer months.

                  A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the

                  ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another
                  claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom
                  award for five years in a row for its spectacular floral
                  displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George,

                  the UK.

                  Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky.
                  The town is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside.
                  It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and
                  visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops
                  with handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass
                  studios, and more. The town holds a yearly festival
                  celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and
                  served with a wooden spoon.

                  However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea
                  College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the
                  south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be
                  coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition —
                  every student receives a full-tuition scholarship.

                  Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom
                  era, Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of
                  its cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO
                  World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of

                  The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you
                  would think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above
                  sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the
                  province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest
                  plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up
                  the bulk of Burundi's exports.

                  the Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters of

                  Located in the state of New Mexico, Roswell is a growing city
                  that is home to a thriving population of almost 50,000
                  residents. Roswell is well-known not only for aliens, but for
                  local hospitality in welcoming new residents and visitors
                  alike. It is home to several museums, a well-known military
                  academy, a state park and wildlife refuge, with a downtown
                  area full of local small shops and restaurants. Roswell takes
                  its history with extraterrestrial beings very seriously.

                <p class="card__content-paragraph">
                  Roswell has benefited from interest in the alleged UFO
                  incident of 1947. It was the report of an object that crashed
                  on a ranch several miles northwest of Roswell on July 7, 1947,
                  allegedly an extraterrestrial spacecraft and its alien
                  occupants. Since the late 1970s the incident has been the
                  subject of intense controversy and of a conspiracy theory
                  regarding classified government programs. Many UFO proponents
                  maintain that an alien craft was found and its deceased
                  occupants were recovered, followed by a military cover-up.
