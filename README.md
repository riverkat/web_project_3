# Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**What has been added**

This project is a gallery showcasing different cities around the world, including photos and descriptions. It was built referencing a design on Figma, and uses HTML, CSS, both flexbox and grid layouts, and responsive design to fit various device screen sizes.
